### Implementation of Optimal Computing Budget Allocation (OCBA)
#### The file named OCBA1 is from paper:
_'Simulation Budget Allocation for Further Enhancing the Efficiency of Ordinal Optimization'_

#### Another one is from paper:
_'Efficient Computing Budget Allocation for Simulation-Based Policy Improvement'_
#### -For OCBAPI, we only consider the simple base policy, and due to the simulation is somehow time-consuming only 500 replications were implemented. For this reason, the next step is to improve the simulation efficiency.(i.e., maybe the MDP is time-consuming during the simulation procedure)
